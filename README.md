# Atom RSpec Runner Package

----

**Warning: This package is alpha and probably buggy,** but I decided to share
my progress for those who are interested. Proceed at your own risk!

-----

Add ability to run RSpec and see the output without leaving Atom.

HotKeys:

- __Ctrl+Alt+T__ - executes all specs the current file
- __Ctrl+Alt+X__ - executes only the spec on the line the cursor's at
- __Ctrl+Alt+E__ - re-executes the last executed spec
